          <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-4">
            We may transfer personal information that we collect or that you
            provide us to contractors, service providers, and other third
            parties we use to support the App (such as analytics providers that
            assist us with App improvement and optimization) and who are
            contractually obligated to keep personal information confidential,
            to use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them,
            and to process the personal information with the same standards set
            out in this policy. By submitting your personal information or
            engaging with the App, you consent to this transfer, storage, or
            processing.

          <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-4">
            The security of your personal information is very important to us.
            We use physical, electronic, and administrative measures designed to
            secure your personal information from accidental loss and from
            unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-4">
            The safety and security of your information also depends on you.
            Where we have given you (or you have chosen) a password for access
            to certain parts of our App, you are responsible for keeping it
            confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet and
            mobile platforms is not completely secure. Although we do our best
            to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the
            security of your personal information transmitted through the App.
            Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are
            not responsible for circumvention of any App privacy settings or
            security measures.

            Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or
            regulation, we will only retain your personal information for as
            long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for,
            including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or
            reporting requirements. Under some circumstances we may anonymize or
            aggregate your personal information so that it can no longer be
            associated with you. We reserve the right to use such anonymous and
            de-identified data for any legitimate business purpose without
