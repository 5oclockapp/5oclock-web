            5 O'Clock is a mobile application designed to help users in
            exploring and assessing dining and entertainment options within
            their cities. It features an interactive platform where users can
            provide real-time reviews and ratings of bars and restaurants. This
            allows others to make informed decisions about their outings based
            on current activity levels and authentic customer experiences shared
            through reviews. Additionally, 5 O'Clock includes a rewards program
            that incentivizes active user participation, by offering
            opportunities to earn points that may be redeemed at participating
            establishments.

            The App includes an interactive platform where users can submit
            reviews, ratings, and pictures of bars and restaurants partnered
            with the Company ("5 O'Clock Establishments"). Users who contribute
            such content are eligible to participate in the App's rewards
            program (the "Rewards Program"). By participating in the Rewards
            Program, users agree to comply with these Terms and Conditions.

          <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Participants in our Rewards Program earn points known as "Minutes".
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Minutes operate on a 5-level tiered system, from 1PM – 5PM ("Reward
            Tiers"). Once a user accumulates 60 'Minutes', they will achieve
            Tier 1 (1PM). Upon earning an additional 60 'Minutes', the user
            progresses to Tier 2 (2PM), continuing sequentially up to Tier 5
            (5PM) with each additional 60 Minutes earned.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Users can redeem their accumulated Minutes for rewards. Also, when
            users unlock a new Reward Tier, they are automatically entered into

            In order to earn Minutes, users must "check in" at the 5 O'Clock
            Establishment(s) that they visit. Our location system automatically
            "checks in" users once they have spent at least 15 minutes during

          <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-4">
            <strong>Leave a review within 48 hours of check in:</strong> Users
            have a 48-hour window to leave a review, rating, and photo of a 5
            O'Clock Establishment that they checked into to earn Minutes.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-4">
            <strong>Post photos to the "Discover Page":</strong> Users earn
            rewards by posting photos on the "Discover Page" while checked in at
            one of our 5 O'Clock Establishments. This feature is available only
            when the user is physically present and checked in at the 5 O'Clock
            Establishment that they wish to post a photo of. This ensures photos
            accurately reflect the real-time appearance of the establishment at
            the time of posting.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Importantly, users can only post one photo to the Discover Page per
            check-in. This means that when checked into a location, a user can
            post a photo of the establishment to the Discover Page at any time
            during their stay.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Once a user posts a photo of a 5 O'Clock Establishment, they cannot
            upload another one for the same check-in session. If, however, the
            user leaves the establishment, visits a new location, and then
            returns to the first establishment, they will be able to post a new
            photo to discovery.

            notice, at any time. Updated information will always be available on

            Users can redeem their accumulated Minutes for various rewards
            corresponding to the Reward Tier that they unlocked that month. Each
            Reward Tier provides users with different types of rewards, which
            may include, without limitation, gift cards, discounts, and other
            exclusive offers at participating 5 O'Clock Establishments.

            The Company reserves the right to determine reward offerings at its
            sole discretion. These offerings are subject to change without prior

            corresponding Minutes required for redemption can always be found on
            the "How It Works" page of the App. Reward options may be added to
            or removed from the App at any time.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-4">
            Users can only redeem their accumulated Minutes for rewards
            corresponding to the Reward Tier they fully unlocked that month.
            This means, for example, if you have enough Minutes to unlock Tier 2
            but not Tier 3, you can only redeem your Minutes for the Tier 2
            reward.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-300 mb-4">
            The Minutes that you collect reset monthly, starting on the first
            day of each month. This means even if you reach Tier 5 rewards one
            month, your Minutes accumulation resets to Tier 1 at the beginning
            of the next month.
